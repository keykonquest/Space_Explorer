# Space_Explorer
A multi-page, responsive website demo of a virtual space exploration tour. There are 4 main pages and 8 subpages, resulting in 12 overall. The idea was inspired by a front-end developer challenge I did on Frontend Mentor (Link below).

The website incorporates fonts found on google fonts; if your machine is unable to render them, they will default to your machine's native font families.
